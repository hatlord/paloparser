Paloparser will take the XML file from either a PaloAlto firewall, or the Panorama management console. It will then create an excel spreadsheet. Depending on the type of file parsed, some sheets may be empty, mainly because im too lazy to sort it out.

Install:

bundle install

Usage:

./paloparser.rb paloconfig.xml
